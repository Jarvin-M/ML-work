26_12_2018 are without extra transformations on the training data for the GAN(so they collapsed more)
27_12_2018 are with the extra transformations on GAN training data
28_12_2018 have extra plots for inter_class_difference and add 2 times as many generated pictures to the alexnet training set.
29_12_2018 little bit of color shift and increased the epochs for the GAN to 50000
01_01_2019 is training alexnets with only generated training data
09_01_2019 half run only generated same but with jarvins classifier
10_01_2019 everythinh with jarvins classifier
12_01_2019 thijs classifier with 64*64 dense input and 600 epochs on alexnet, also lower the batch_size to 15
13_01_2019 thijs classifier with ¨¨ also lower the batch_size to 8
14_01_2019 batch_size back to 15, replace collapsed classes with original training data
15_01_2019 """"
16_01_2019_og """" only original data
17_01_2019_meh same with too much decay
18_01_2019 all decay seems to be too much, maybe use sgd?
